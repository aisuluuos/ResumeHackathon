      <h2>Projects & Achievements</h2>
      <p>
        Leadership is a vital skill that is essential for success in any school
        <br />
        or community, and I am proud to say that I have had ample opportunity
        <br />
        to develop and apply my leadership skills in various settings. My <br />
        experiences as a president of the student council, co-founder of the
        <br />
        nonprofit organization "Unity," finalist in the Technovation Girls
        <br />
        Kyrgyzstan project under the US Embassy and participating competitions
        and
        <br />
        Olympiads in the Computer Science field have helped me to hone my
        <br />communication, problem-solving, and decision-making skills, which
        are <br />
        essential for effective leadership. For a long time, my life consisted
        <br />
        of training in taekwondo and my project to open the first volunteer
        <br />
        organization in our school. These are the very things that I am most
        <br />
        proud of. Sports have always been an integral part of my life and I was
        <br />
        finally able to achieve my black belt, I am grateful to myself for the
        <br />
        persistence and hard work and also for not giving up after the injury
        and
        <br />
        finally achieving my goal. Throughout high school, we were able to start
        <br />
        our club and completed a lot of cool projects, which I'm very proud of.
        <br />
        One of the main projects that I led was a project to help children from
        <br />
        low-income families and orphans obtain soft skills and assistance
        (tutoring) <br />
        in subjects such as mathematics, English and Russian.
